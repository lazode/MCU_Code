A STM32f103 code about a controller with a Voltmeter Circut

-------------------------

#The develop board has been burned
#I should add a 74HC245 circut with the board's IO ports

--------------------------

I use a new development board compelet my work, and this code can be work well. 
Now, this code can work with the Circuts at the directory: /EMWIN_Test/Circut_PCB.
